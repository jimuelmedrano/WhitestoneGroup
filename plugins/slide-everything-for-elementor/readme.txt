Creates a simple Swiper slider out of container elements. Flexbox has to be active.

== How to use it ==

https://youtu.be/s8oyX1u-T6E

* create a horizontal container and give it an ID (Advanced - CSS ID)
* add multiple sub containers (those are the slides)
* add the `Slide everything` widget somewhere in the page
* set the ID of the container in "Slider ID"
* change some settings
* preview the page

Events:

You can listen to the `miga_slide_everything_init` event to get informed when the slider is ready to use:
```
document.addEventListener("miga_slide_everything_init", function(e) {
  alert("ready");
});
```

Currently only working with one slider in your page!
